# Swap

Swap Is an application built by two High School Students - David Slakter and Micheal Bingham

We created this app in order to make it easier for people to connect on the fly across any social media account. 
Our vision for swap was to be a 'personal passport' into the social media world.

After connecting their social medias, a user would be equiped with a custom QR code that can be scanned by other swap users.
Social Media sharing for a certain profile could be switched on and off by tapping the icons below the QR code.
